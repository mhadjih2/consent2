        <p>By agreeing with these Terms and Conditions you consent to and license us to publish your own music and play it on our platform for an indefinite period of time.&nbsp;
        <p>We do not own your music, this means you are in control and you will stay in control and retain all the rights to your music and your content. If you no longer want us to play your song(s) or want the already published content to be removed, you can send us an email stating such, where upon we will remove the music from the broadcast within a reasonable period of time.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>We play your music for promotional purposes, for you as an artist as well as the promotion of our platform, and we expect the upload(s) of your songs to be original works of which you are the legal owner. Remember the content you send remains under your ownership or control. Please ensure again that the uploaded content is indeed yours and your content does not infringe on any rights. If a third party makes a claim that the rights to the music belong to them, or you might be infringing on any rights at all for that matter, then you are responsible for any and all material and immaterial damages that may follow from this. You are also the one who is legally responsible for the broadcasted music and therefor are liable for all damages.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When a third party states a claim on the music you provided to us for broadcasting, we will contact you and inform you of the notice that we received and send you a copy of the notice of copyright infringement if available, or otherwise applicable grievances pertaining to having to remove your song(s). As a precaution we will remove said songs as stated in the received claim and will not put the song(s) up again until the matter between you and the third party is fully resolved. If you can provide us with documentation that indicates that you are the rightful owner and the claim is obviously bogus, we'll restore the broadcast of course.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>You are acknowledging to have read these Terms and Conditions and by digitally signing and confirming the form on the webpage ucr.livegiggy.com, you state you understand these Terms and Conditions, took complete notice,&nbsp; and fully consent to them.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Rather obviously we won't play any content that might offend or grieve other people in any way possible, specifically targeting race, religion or otherwise. Also too explicit lyrics will be a ground for removal or not adding your uploaded song(s). We make the decision to play your songs(s) and there's no appeal possible if we don't, or won't play it anymore.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>UCR will not charge you any amount of money for the promotion of your songs or the continuous play of the songs in the broadcast(s) of UCR. All this is free and will remain so, and is meant for the benefit of you as well as us.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Thank you for your patience reading this! ;-)</p>
